“Parker is a sales manager who manages a team of 50 sales representatives. He wants to create an
application to handle his sales team and is looking forward in introducing the new system to other
sales mangers within the company as well. As an initial stage, he wanted to update the system
with a list of names of his team. Unfortunately parker is currently updating a spread sheet with
names of his team, their email addresses, telephone numbers, joined dates, current working
routes and comments of the managers.”
